Troubleshooting:

If your Horion Injector says "DLL Not Loaded" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Sign out of all other Windows accounts (antivirus might be enabled on that account)
-Make sure Minecraft is set to windowed mode (in Video Settings, turn off "Fullscreen")
-Redownload the files at https://horionbeta.club and EXTRACT the files to a folder
-Make sure there aren't any antiviruses that you don't know about on your PC (adware, bundled downloads, etc.)
-Make sure Real-Time Protection is turned off in your Windows settings (look up how to turn off if you don't know how)
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.

If your Horion Injector says "C++ out of date" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Install Visual Studio from this link: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
-If this fails, you might have to fix the Visual Studio installation from the installer linked above.
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.

If you need help with Horion in-game, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Use .help in the game chat to see all commands or go to this link to see the list of all commands (this includes beta commands so they might not all work if you use Horion Public): https://spyynz.org/dev/downloads/horioncmd.txt
-Inject Horion into your game twice. This will reset all config and settings that could've been previously messed with and it can fix problems with commands not working or modules not functioning.
-Ask in the Horion Discord and you might get lucky if somebody knows the answer (not reliable). Discord Link: https://discord.gg/6ZqjHYR
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.
