Troubleshooting:

If your Horion Injector says "DLL Not Loaded" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Sign out of all other Windows accounts (antivirus might be enabled on that account)
-Make sure Minecraft is set to windowed mode (in Video Settings, turn off "Fullscreen")
-Download .net core https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download then reinstall the client.
-Redownload the files at https://horionbeta.club and EXTRACT the files to a folder
-Make sure there aren't any antiviruses that you don't know about on your PC (adware, bundled downloads, etc.)
-Make sure Real-Time Protection is turned off in your Windows settings (look up how to turn off if you don't know how)
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If your Horion Injector says "C++ out of date" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Install Visual Studio from this link: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
-If this fails, you might have to fix the Visual Studio installation from the installer linked above.
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If you need help with Horion in-game, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Use .help in the game chat to see all commands or go to this link to see the list of all commands (this includes beta commands so they might not all work if you use Horion Public): https://spyynz.org/dev/downloads/horioncmd.txt
-Inject Horion into your game twice. This will reset all config and settings that could've been previously messed with and it can fix problems with commands not working or modules not functioning.
-Ask in the Horion Discord and you might get lucky if somebody knows the answer (not reliable). Discord Link: https://discord.gg/6ZqjHYR
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If your minecraft is crashing when you inject or join a world/server try these troubleshooting methods:
-Put your game in windowed mode and make the window smaller
-Log out of Xbox Live before injecting
-Log out of all other Windows accounts before injecting

Common Questions:

How much is beta?
Beta is $5 a month with the Horion Patreon.

What does beta have that public doesn't?
- NBT (NBT allows you to modify block data, so for example we can spawn in a shulker full of items with 32k enchantments, and monster spawners that spawn around 50 withers a second.)
- Joe* [pathfinder] (A pathfinder bot. You use the command .path xyz <x coord> <y coord> <z coord> and it will find the most efficient path to the coordinates you set and then control your player and execute the fastest route. If you want a better description just look up Baritone.)
However, beta also gets the client updates earlier than public, and it gives you access to the better channels on the discord which can provide more help for you.

To open up the hack menu, hit the insert key. If you would like to change what key toggles what commands type this in chat:
.bind <module> <key>

So if you want to change the hack menu from insert to another key such as tab, you would type .bind clickgui tab
(Note: you can view all the modules with the .modules command)

Common Give Commands:
.give 466 64 enchanted golden apples
.give 383 64 52 wither spawn egg
.give 383 64 53 ender dragon spawn egg
.give 383 64 63 player spawn egg
Here is the full list of item ID's https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/c/c6/DataValuesPE.png?version=b4c261e3c01eca5dedcce349917039d7

Enchantments:
In order to enchant an item use this command:
.enchant <enchantment id> <level>
You can also use .enchant all to give an item max enchantments.

The teleport command ONLY WORKS IN RENDER DISTANCE

Updates:

June 23, 2020;
NOTE:
Horion is not yet compatible with the brand new 1.16 Minecraft update.
Please never ask for an "eta" in the Discord. The devs are working hard to make all modules functional.
Just be patient.
1.16 compatibility will be out for beta in a few days.
1.16 compatibility will be out for public in a few weeks.
Thanks for understanding!

Day 1:
It ain't bad, but the Discord is full of people
spamming about Horion not working. It is very
annoying and irritating but we can get through it
together.

Day 2:
I’m starting to get used to not holding down F for
jetpack. I’m getting used to being a normie without
any hacks or modules. I am improving my skills and
getting better at the actual game.

Day 3:
Not sure where the Horion Public release is, since
they had a fully working release a few days ago.
They are probably just doing this for money.

Day 4:
I’m getting bored of Minecraft, but I decided to start
playing on a realm. The people seem nice, but it's
odd playing legit on a realm. I feel like something's
missing...

Day 5:
I have been on Discord for 5 hours straight, waiting
for a 1.16 release. I was sitting in VC listening to
the Bible for 2 hours earlier and now I’m listening to
Mr. Beast count for 24 hours.

Day 6:
Nearly a week now. I have now stopped pressing P whenever
someone beats me in a fight and have learned to defend
myself in many different ways. I never knew how difficult
this game could be, but it has strengthened me greatly.

Day 7:
One full week. What now? When will the public release be?
All I have now are questions. Questions about the outside
world. Questions about "what" and "why". What am I waiting
for? Why am I waiting for it?

Day 8:
I’m starting to lose control. I haven't been on Minecraft today.
This hasn't happened for 2 years. I died in survival yesterday
and ever since then, I had no motivation. What do I do? Am
I diseased? Am I dying? I have never felt anything like this
before.

Day 9:
I think I just deleted a folder called System32 because someone
said it would make Horion Public work on 1.16 but nothing happened.
Now my computer says that it can't restart or power up. It doesn't
really bother me too much since I wasn't expecting it to
work.

Day 10:
I feel sick. I feel dead. I don't function how I used to.
I can barely move my right arm. I haven't gotten out of
bed today. I don't plan on it either. There's nothing
left to life. What do I still have? Who do I still have?
It was just days, yet it feels as if I have been waiting
years. It's too early, yet too late. Nothing left.

Day 11:
Where is the time kept? How do I run? How do I hide? Where
can I hide? Where? Someone must know. I lost my credit card,
I lost my keys, I lost my mind. I can barely hold my head up
anymore. What now? Where now? Nothing..

Day 12:
Time is nothing. Time is everything. Time is lost. Where is it?
Gone. Time is gone. That's it. That's the problem. Time.
It's lost. It's gone. It cannot find me. I am lost. I am gone.
I can't find time. Time can't find me. What are we here for?
We aren't here. We are nothing. We are gone. Nothing left.
Nothing anymore.

Day 13:
Nearly 2 weeks? No. Nearly 14 days? No. Not even close. Time isn't
anymore. Time goes around me. Time is tied around me. Time has locked me.
Time has me locked to the bed. Time is stuck. It has been daytime forever.
I’m never here for night, or night is never here for me. Which is it?
I don't quite know anymore.

Day 14:
How am I here? Time let me through. The invisible being. Time. Grows more
and more each day, hour, minute, second. Constant growth. No way to escape.
No way to unlock. No way to untie the rope. No way to shatter the glass,
break down the door, jump over the wall, break the restraints. No way.
There never will. Ever.

Day 15:
Where am I? I am gone again. I was always gone. I've gone from there.
Gone from gone. Was it one week? Two? Three? Four? Five? Six? Seven?
How many? There's no way to tell. No way. There never will. Ever.

Day 16:
I found it. Gone. I’m gone again. No longer gone, but gone. Gone is all
I will be. What was I waiting for? Horion? Sounds like a silly, made-up
name. What is it again? Minecraft? What's that? A game? I don't recall.
Is it like hide and seek? No? Is it like playing tag? No? I’m not sure
what you mean. I have not played it. Have I? I wouldn't know. I’m lost.
Dead. Gone. No more to me. Just a substance. A being. Not even that.
A human? Sounds like a silly, made-up name. I am a human? How so? What
makes me one? Why am I chosen to be one? I’m no longer anything. I am
gone.

Day 17:
