Horion Troubleshooting by Spyynz#9654
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:

If your Horion Injector says "DLL Not Loaded" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Sign out of all other Windows accounts (antivirus might be enabled on that account)
-Make sure Minecraft is set to windowed mode (in Video Settings, turn off "Fullscreen")
-Download .net core https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download then reinstall the client.
-Redownload the files at https://horionbeta.club and EXTRACT the files to a folder
-Make sure there aren't any antiviruses that you don't know about on your PC (adware, bundled downloads, etc.)
-Make sure Real-Time Protection is turned off in your Windows settings (look up how to turn off if you don't know how)
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If your Horion Injector says "C++ out of date" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Install Visual Studio from this link: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
-If this fails, you might have to fix the Visual Studio installation from the installer linked above.
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If you need help with Horion in-game, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Use .help in the game chat to see all commands or go to this link to see the list of all commands (this includes beta commands so they might not all work if you use Horion Public): https://spyynz.org/dev/downloads/horioncmd.txt
-Inject Horion into your game twice. This will reset all config and settings that could've been previously messed with and it can fix problems with commands not working or modules not functioning.
-Ask in the Horion Discord and you might get lucky if somebody knows the answer (not reliable). Discord Link: https://discord.gg/6ZqjHYR
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Lunity, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. This client is currently in early access, but will be released soon. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a great alternative.

If your minecraft is crashing when you inject or join a world/server try these troubleshooting methods:
-Put your game in windowed mode and make the window smaller
-Log out of Xbox Live before injecting
-Log out of all other Windows accounts before injecting

Common Questions:

How much is beta?
Beta is $5 a month with the Horion Patreon.

What does beta have that public doesn't?
- NBT (NBT allows you to modify block data, so for example we can spawn in a shulker full of items with 32k enchantments, and monster spawners that spawn around 50 withers a second.)
- Joe* [pathfinder] (A pathfinder bot. You use the command .path xyz <x coord> <y coord> <z coord> and it will find the most efficient path to the coordinates you set and then control your player and execute the fastest route. If you want a better description just look up Baritone.)
However, beta also gets the client updates earlier than public, and it gives you access to the better channels on the discord which can provide more help for you.

To open up the hack menu, hit the insert key. If you would like to change what key toggles what commands type this in chat:
.bind <module> <key>

So if you want to change the hack menu from insert to another key such as tab, you would type .bind clickgui tab
(Note: you can view all the modules with the .modules command)

Common Give Commands:
.give 466 64 enchanted golden apples
.give 383 64 52 wither spawn egg
.give 383 64 53 ender dragon spawn egg
.give 383 64 63 player spawn egg
Here is the full list of item ID's https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/c/c6/DataValuesPE.png?version=b4c261e3c01eca5dedcce349917039d7

Enchantments:
In order to enchant an item use this command:
.enchant <enchantment id> <level>
You can also use .enchant all to give an item max enchantments.

The teleport command ONLY WORKS IN RENDER DISTANCE
