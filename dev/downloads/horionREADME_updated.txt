Troubleshooting:

If your Horion Injector says "DLL Not Loaded" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Sign out of all other Windows accounts (antivirus might be enabled on that account)
-Make sure Minecraft is set to windowed mode (in Video Settings, turn off "Fullscreen")
-Download .net core https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download then reinstall the client.
-Redownload the files at https://horionbeta.club and EXTRACT the files to a folder
-Make sure there aren't any antiviruses that you don't know about on your PC (adware, bundled downloads, etc.)
-Make sure Real-Time Protection is turned off in your Windows settings (look up how to turn off if you don't know how)
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.

If your Horion Injector says "C++ out of date" or something similar, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Install Visual Studio from this link: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
-If this fails, you might have to fix the Visual Studio installation from the installer linked above.
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.

If you need help with Horion in-game, try these troubleshooting methods:
-Use .help in the game chat to see all commands or go to this link to see the list of all commands (this includes beta commands so they might not all work if you use Horion Public): https://spyynz.org/dev/downloads/horioncmd.txt
-Inject Horion into your game twice. This will reset all config and settings that could've been previously messed with and it can fix problems with commands not working or modules not functioning.
-Ask in the Horion Discord and you might get lucky if somebody knows the answer (not reliable). Discord Link: https://discord.gg/6ZqjHYR
-If all else fails and Horion is not working for you, consider downloading Flare, a different client for Minecraft that has similar features. Although it isn't as feature-packed, it is still a usable client.

If your minecraft is crashing when you inject or join a world/server try these troubleshooting methods:
-Put your game in windowed mode and make the window smaller
-Log out of Xbox Live before injecting
-Log out of all other Windows accounts before injecting

IF ALL ELSE FAILS, THERE IS HOPE!!! Someone got it to work by moving Windows Defender onto a separate drive and unplugging the drive (can be a USB stick or something similar). This will fully remove Windows Defender.

Common Questions:

How much is beta?
Beta is $5 a month with the Horion Patreon.

What does beta have that public doesn't?
Right now the biggest difference in the client is that beta has nbt load and write which allows you to modify block deta. For example we can spawn a shulker full of 32k items or a wither spawner.
However, beta also gets the client updates earlier than public, and it gives you access to the better channels on the discord which can provide more help for you.

To open up the hack menu, hit the insert key. If you would like to change what key toggles what commands type this in chat:
.bind <module> <key>

So if you want to change the hack menu from insert to another key such as tab, you would type .bind clickgui tab
(Note: you can view all the modules with the .modules command)

Common Give Commands:
.give 466 64 or use .give appleenchanted 64 - enchanted golden apples
.give 383 64 52 or use .give spawn_egg 64 52 - wither spawn egg
.give 383 64 53 or use .give spawn_egg 64 53 - ender dragon spawn egg (kinda broken)

Enchantments:
In order to enchant an item use this command:
.enchant <enchantment id> <level>
You can also use .enchant all to give an item max enchantments or .enchant all <level> to get a custom level of all enchants
