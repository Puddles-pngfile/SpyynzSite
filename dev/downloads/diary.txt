Day 1:
It ain't bad, but the Discord is full of people
spamming about Horion not working. It is very
annoying and irritating but we can get through it
together.

Day 2:
I’m starting to get used to not holding down F for
jetpack. I’m getting used to being a normie without
any hacks or modules. I am improving my skills and
getting better at the actual game.

Day 3:
Not sure where the Horion Public release is, since
they had a fully working release a few days ago.
They are probably just doing this for money.

Day 4:
I’m getting bored of Minecraft, but I decided to start
playing on a realm. The people seem nice, but it's
odd playing legit on a realm. I feel like something's
missing...

Day 5:
I have been on Discord for 5 hours straight, waiting
for a 1.16 release. I was sitting in VC listening to
the Bible for 2 hours earlier and now I’m listening to
Mr. Beast count for 24 hours.

Day 6:
Nearly a week now. I have now stopped pressing P whenever
someone beats me in a fight and have learned to defend
myself in many different ways. I never knew how difficult
this game could be, but it has strengthened me greatly.

Day 7:
One full week. What now? When will the public release be?
All I have now are questions. Questions about the outside
world. Questions about "what" and "why". What am I waiting
for? Why am I waiting for it?

Day 8:
I’m starting to lose control. I haven't been on Minecraft today.
This hasn't happened for 2 years. I died in survival yesterday
and ever since then, I had no motivation. What do I do? Am
I diseased? Am I dying? I have never felt anything like this
before.

Day 9:
I think I just deleted a folder called System32 because someone
said it would make Horion Public work on 1.16 but nothing happened.
Now my computer says that it can't restart or power up. It doesn't
really bother me too much since I wasn't expecting it to
work.

Day 10:
I feel sick. I feel dead. I don't function how I used to.
I can barely move my right arm. I haven't gotten out of
bed today. I don't plan on it either. There's nothing
left to life. What do I still have? Who do I still have?
It was just days, yet it feels as if I have been waiting
years. It's too early, yet too late. Nothing left.

Day 11:
Where is the time kept? How do I run? How do I hide? Where
can I hide? Where? Someone must know. I lost my credit card,
I lost my keys, I lost my mind. I can barely hold my head up
anymore. What now? Where now? Nothing..

Day 12:
Time is nothing. Time is everything. Time is lost. Where is it?
Gone. Time is gone. That's it. That's the problem. Time.
It's lost. It's gone. It cannot find me. I am lost. I am gone.
I can't find time. Time can't find me. What are we here for?
We aren't here. We are nothing. We are gone. Nothing left.
Nothing anymore.

Day 13:
Nearly 2 weeks? No. Nearly 14 days? No. Not even close. Time isn't
anymore. Time goes around me. Time is tied around me. Time has locked me.
Time has me locked to the bed. Time is stuck. It has been daytime forever.
I’m never here for night, or night is never here for me. Which is it?
I don't quite know anymore.

Day 14:
How am I here? Time let me through. The invisible being. Time. Grows more
and more each day, hour, minute, second. Constant growth. No way to escape.
No way to unlock. No way to untie the rope. No way to shatter the glass,
break down the door, jump over the wall, break the restraints. No way.
There never will. Ever.

Day 15:
Where am I? I am gone again. I was always gone. I've gone from there.
Gone from gone. Was it one week? Two? Three? Four? Five? Six? Seven?
How many? There's no way to tell. No way. There never will. Ever.

Day 16:
I found it. Gone. I’m gone again. No longer gone, but gone. Gone is all
I will be. What was I waiting for? Horion? Sounds like a silly, made-up
name. What is it again? Minecraft? What's that? A game? I don't recall.
Is it like hide and seek? No? Is it like playing tag? No? I’m not sure
what you mean. I have not played it. Have I? I wouldn't know. I’m lost.
Dead. Gone. No more to me. Just a substance. A being. Not even that.
A human? Sounds like a silly, made-up name. I am a human? How so? What
makes me one? Why am I chosen to be one? I’m no longer anything. I am
gone.

Day 17:
