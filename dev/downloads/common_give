Note: For items with NBTs (items with {} after the command) when you use the command, copy from one backet to the other, and put a space at the end of the give command. You don't need to paste the part inside of the brackets,
it reads it from your clipboard. However you need to put a space at the end of the command for it to add the NBT data.
